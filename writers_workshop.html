<p>The ArmadilloCon Writers' Workshop has become a major event for aspiring SF/F writers. It meets before the convention on Friday morning at 9am and runs until about 4:30pm. Workshop curriculum is designed for beginning and intermediate students. Workshop participants are given the opportunity to have their work critiqued by major professional editors and/or writers. The workshop will cover craft, markets, the dos and don'ts of preparing your work for professional publication, and more. Discussions range from the basics of style to plot, theme, character, and setting. Within the breakout session, students receive an in-depth critique of their work from both instructors and peers. At the workshop, students receive a personal, in-depth critique of their work from instructors and peers, utilizing the Milford style. This roundtable style critique session is invaluable for learning what works, what doesn't, and how to edit your work.</p>

<ul class="inside-text">
<li class="inside-text">MAXIMUM LENGTH IS 5,000 WORDS. The word count limit is FIRM. No exceptions. Manuscripts longer than the maximum length will be shortened at the ArmadilloCon 38 offices without notice.</li>
<li class="inside-text">You may send either a short story or the FIRST CHAPTER of a novel. Short stories are preferred due to the limited time frame. Regardless of your normal working length, a short story will better highlight your talents as a writer in this setting.</li>
<li class="inside-text">If sending a complete short story, make sure you write The End on the last page; otherwise, indicate that the story continues after the first 5,000 words. </li>
<li class="inside-text">If the first chapter of a novel, indicate on the first page that it is chapter one. This will ensure that the pros will be able to evaluate each manuscript properly. </li>
<li class="inside-text">Please do not use pen names on workshop submissions as it causes confusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note the Coordinators will only view the manuscript after you have bought a membership payment and the permission slip has been received. </p>
